## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
## Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python installed. If not, install it from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can install the required libraries for your Flask app by using pip. Assuming you already have a requirements.txt file or want to manually install each dependency, follow these steps:

# Flask Application Setup Guide

## Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have Python installed. If not, install it from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can install the required libraries for your Flask app by using `pip`. Assuming you already have a `requirements.txt` file or want to manually install each dependency, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Using `requirements.txt`

If you have a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the dependencies for your Flask application, simply run the following command to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Manually Installing Dependencies

You can manually install each required library as listed below:

* **Flask**: For creating the web app.
  ```bash
  pip install Flask
  ```

* **pandas**: For handling data (used for CSV or Excel file processing).
  ```bash
  pip install pandas
  ```

* **matplotlib**: For generating graphs or tables in your Flask app.
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

* **openpyxl**: For reading and writing Excel files (optional if you're working with `.xlsx` files).
  ```bash
  pip install openpyxl
  ```

* **io**: This is a built-in Python library, so you don't need to install it separately.
* **base64**: Also a built-in Python library, no need to install.
* **re**: A built-in module for working with regular expressions.

## SSH for Port Tunneling

You don't need to install anything for SSH port tunneling as it's built into most Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS. For Windows, you can use tools like PuTTY or install OpenSSH.

## How to set up Port Tunneling

To set up the API on localhost for my Android app, I first created five separate files, each designed to handle different chatbot queries. These files run on different ports to manage specific requests. It’s crucial that both the mobile device running the Android app and the laptop running the API files are connected to the same local network, such as Wi-Fi. To start the API servers on the laptop, I ran each file on its designated port using commands like python chatbot_query1.py --port 5001 and so on for the other files. In the Android app, I configured the API base URL to point to the laptop’s local IP address and the respective ports. For instance, if the laptop’s IP address is 192.168.1.100, the base URL for the first chatbot query would be http://192.168.1.100:5001. Finally, I tested the setup by running the Android app to ensure it could successfully make API calls to the localhost servers on the laptop, verifying that each chatbot query was handled correctly by the respective API file.

## Login Information
To log in to the app, use the following credentials:

ID: 123
Password: 12345

## Usage
Interact with the chatbot via the provided API endpoints.
Use Postman or any HTTP client to send requests to the local API.
